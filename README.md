# Wyoming Toucan

This repository provides a server implementation for the [Wyoming protocol](https://github.com/rhasspy/wyoming) designed to work with the [Toucan](https://github.com/DigitalPhonetics/IMS-Toucan) text-to-speech system.

The code is based on the [Piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper/) repository, which is a powerful text-to-speech engine.

## Overview

This project is a proof of concept, and it currently runs on my local Home Assistant (HA) installation. It showcases the integration of the Wyoming protocol with the Toucan text-to-speech system. While it’s not yet ready for full production use, it’s an exciting step toward making this functionality available.

## Features

- Integration of the Wyoming protocol with the Toucan TTS system
- Based on the Piper text-to-speech engine
- Currently functioning as a local solution for Home Assistant

## Future Plans

- This may become a Home Assistant Add-On in the future
- Improvements to functionality and performance based on user feedback

## Installation

For now, this is only a local proof of concept. Please feel free to experiment with it in your environment. Detailed installation instructions will be provided in future versions if the project evolves into a more mature Add-On.

## Disclaimer

This project is still in its early stages and is not intended for widespread production use. It is primarily for experimentation and learning purposes.
